# Robot Challenge
This is my solution to a coding challenge for IOOF (https://github.com/ioof-holdings/recruitment/wiki/Robot-Challenge). I wrote it C because I enjoy learning about this extremely important and influential language.

The program requires a `commands.txt` to be placed in the same directory as the binary. The file should contain valid commands listed line-by-line, starting with a `PLACE` command.
